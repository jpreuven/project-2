# Musicle - Music Library Database
## Description

Musicle is a music library database project that allows users to search for their favorite artists or bands and view relevant information about them. While Musicle currently provides basic functionality for searching and exploring artists, there are many opportunities for future enhancements and features with the right resources.

## Getting Started

• `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

• **Enhanced Search:** Expanding the search functionality to include searching by genre and providing better search results.
