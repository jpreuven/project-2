###
Musicle is site that is essentially a music library database that at this time allows users to search for a Artist or Band name and see a page with relevent information.

There was plans to add more features and functionality but the api that is currently being implemented is not sufficient to make these implementations. 

Some future goals with the right resources could be implementing a integrated player to listen to music, adding ability to search for artists based on genre/not have the search be limited to exact matches, and having more information available on aritst/track/album pages overall.
